<h4>You can always count on me when you need some help with anything. Also if you need some peace and quiet because I'm a calm guy so I keep calm and don't stress.

<h5>A funny story</h5>
<p>My first time snowboarding I had to use a T-bar ski lift for the first time. My friends, who already had some experience, told I was all going to be okay, it was very easy. So when we get there I realise you have to put the bar between your legs and it will drag you up. So I try and, as expected, fail miserably lots of times with my snowboard and all the people watching. At the end, when I thought I had succeeded, I fell off of it. I literally just grabbed the bar lay face down and let it drag me all the way up.
</p>
<h6>TL;DR</h6>

<p>I basically just let a T-bar ski lift drag me up face down on the snow in front of dozens of people.</p>
